Telegram bot that suggests food or drink places based on user input.
Note that Telegram has no way to save state for user; a database has to be built for saving commands of user

More functionalities to add:
1. Asks the user if he/she wants food or drinks and will return the necessary function
2. Randomly suggest 5 recs (not nearby)

i.e. 
/where
Bot: Your location
User: 10D Robey Crescent -> Store it somewhere
Bot: Food or drinks?
User: Food -> Store it somewhere

Pass both arguments in function to return recs
